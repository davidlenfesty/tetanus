# webserver

Dumb webserver I'm writing using Rust to get a good feel for the language.

I want it to just implement a "clone" of my current website, where it implements a folder like structure for everything.

A page should have the basic layout:

- Header
    - Static, info about me
    - links to top level directories
- Body
    - User customizable content.
    - maybe support markdown in here, or a subset of it
- list of subdirs/files
    - list of subdirectories or files
    - each subdir/file should have a small piece of text next to it to describe it
- footer

I think I want to use some form of SQL or something for the data backend.
The editor I think is just going to be a series of text boxes for each page.
Maybe I'll come up with something else
or maybe I'll switch to a static file parser
idk.
