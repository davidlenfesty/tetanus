# Tetanus: My experiments with rust #

I thought the name was cool and you know, why not put your
crappy code straight onto github.

Essentially this is going to be where I throw stuff I do with rust.
Nothing in this repo will ever get published elsewhere.
If I do stumble on something interesting, I will move it out
into it's own repo.

Mainly this is buildup to my big project, a rust-powered ARM ethernet dev board,
learning rust to a point where I actually understand the language,
and could hopefully contribute to the embedded working group
(even if I don't actually contribute).
