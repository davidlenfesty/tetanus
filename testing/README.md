# Blinky! #

This was just so I could get an intro to how I might implement an
application using Rust on embedded hardware.

Things I've learned:

- Rust is quite complicated. Quite a bit more complicated than C.
- Use RTFM, it provides some really nice interfaces, and even though it may kind of seem like magic immediately it makes sense
- I need to find a way to make full register writes safe (any suggestions?)
- I need to *actually* learn rust. I'm not going to get the hardware to work on my planned project (an ethernet-enabled dev board) until April or so, so in the meantime I'm going to write some stuff in rust. (probably in this repo)
